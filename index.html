        <h1>Possessing Allah's Attributes</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This article explores the concept of humans possessing certain attributes of Allah and the responsibilities that come with them. To understand this, it is essential to acknowledge that everything humans have is bestowed by Allah. Humans have created or earned nothing independently; it is all granted by Allah.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Understanding Possession of Allah's Attributes</h2>
        <p>Allah has allowed humans to possess certain of His attributes in a limited capacity. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hearing (Samee)</li>
            <li>Seeing (Baseer)</li>
            <li>Knowledge (Aleem)</li>
            <li>Power (Qadeer)</li>
            <li>Wealth (Ghani)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While Allah possesses these attributes infinitely, humans possess them only within boundaries set by Him.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Humans' Possession of Allah’s Attributes as a Trial</h2>
        <p>The possession of Allah’s attributes by humans is a fitna (test), not inherently a bad thing. For example, children are also referred to as a fitna in the Quran—not because they are evil, but because they are a trial. Similarly, possessing Allah’s attributes is a great trial.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Most Difficult Trials</h2>
        <p>Two of the greatest attributes Allah has given humans are wealth and power.</p>
        <p>Some people would argue that power and wealth are identical. However, they are not! Yes, they are interconnected and quite close, but they are not the same!</p>

        <h3>1. Wealth</h3>
        <p>A person with wealth can live a comfortable life but faces trials of arrogance, misuse, or neglect of responsibilities.</p>

        <h3>2. Power</h3>
        <p>Power is a greater trial than wealth because it is directly linked to Allah’s physical abilities. For instance, Allah does not have gold coins or paper currency. But power physically exists with Allah. When Allah says Kun (Be), things physically happen—like the sun rising and setting, or the creation of the world.</p>
        <p>So, the attributes that physically exist with Allah are bigger trials.</p>
        <p>Attributes like seeing, hearing, speaking, power, and knowledge fall into this category. The Prophet (PBUH) has given us various ahadith about protecting these attributes.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>He (PBUH) said: "The one who guarantees me the protection of what is between their jaws (tongue) and what is between their legs (private parts), I will guarantee them Paradise".</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Among these attributes, even more dangerous are the attributes through which you can influence others.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Danger of Influencing Attributes</h2>
        <p>Attributes that influence others, such as speech and authority, are more dangerous compared to personal attributes like hearing or seeing.</p>
        <p>This means if you are listening to something wrong, it is undoubtedly a sin, but you are not harming anyone other than yourself. Similarly, if you see something bad, you are not harming anyone except yourself.</p>
        <p>But attributes like power and speech are those where you influence others.</p>

        <h3>Consequences of Misusing Influencing Attributes</h3>
        <p>If Allah has given you eyes, and you commit a sin with them, you might be forgiven. But if Allah has given you authority, and you fail to deliver justice, make unfair laws, see oppression but fail to stop it despite having the power, then there will be severe accountability.</p>
        <p>Or, if you misuse your authority to take revenge for personal grudges, as is commonly done by the politicians, law enforcement, or officials today, there will be strict punishment.</p>
        <p>Similarly, if Allah has given you a tongue and you hurt someone with it, there will be severe accountability. However, keep in mind that while speaking the truth, you should not fear hurting feelings. If you have communicated the truth appropriately and someone still gets offended, it is not your sin.</p>
        <p>Allah has gifted humans with limited aspects of His attributes to use them for good. Misusing these attributes for sinful acts will lead to questioning on the Day of Judgment.</p>

	<h3>While concluding, I want to share some tips that we should practice to become more responsible.</h3>
 
        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Speech and Communication:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Practice speaking thoughtfully by ensuring your words do not harm or mislead others.</li>
                    <li>When addressing conflicts or giving advice, use kind and respectful language to avoid hurting someone unnecessarily.</li>
                    <li>Share beneficial knowledge and avoid gossip or falsehoods.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use of Authority:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>If you're in a position of power, ensure justice and fairness in your decisions. For example, a manager should avoid favoritism and treat their team with respect.</li>
                    <li>Speak up against oppression or wrongdoing, even if it’s inconvenient. For instance, if someone is being wronged at work or in your community, take action to help.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Wealth Management:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Use wealth wisely by helping the less fortunate. Sadaqah (charity) not only benefits others but purifies your wealth.</li>
                    <li>Avoid pride in your possessions by remembering that everything comes from Allah. Practice humility by being generous and avoiding ostentation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Influence and Knowledge:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Use your influence to promote good values. If you have a platform or a voice in your community, encourage kindness, honesty, and justice.</li>
                    <li>Share knowledge responsibly, ensuring it benefits others and aligns with Islamic teachings.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Self-Reflection:</strong> Regularly evaluate your actions and intentions. Ask yourself if you are using Allah’s blessings—speech, power, wealth, and knowledge—for the betterment of yourself and others or for harmful purposes.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Seek Forgiveness:</strong> Whenever you realize you’ve misused an attribute, immediately turn to Allah in repentance and seek forgiveness. Make amends with others if necessary.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Encourage Others:</strong> Educate those around you about the proper use of blessings. Be a role model by demonstrating how to use Allah’s attributes responsibly.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Set Goals:</strong> Commit to small, actionable goals, such as speaking kindly daily or donating a portion of your income to charity each month. Challenge yourself to address at least one injustice in your surroundings, whether it’s within your family, workplace, or community.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dua and Reliance on Allah:</strong> Regularly make dua for guidance in using Allah’s blessings wisely. Ask Him to protect you from arrogance, misuse, and accountability for neglect.</li>
        </ul>
